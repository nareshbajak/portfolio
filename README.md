# Portfolio React (Vite + Tailwind)

This project packages your provided `Portfolio` component **without any changes** inside a working React + Vite + Tailwind setup.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The UI uses Tailwind classes already present in your component and `lucide-react` for icons.
